    <h1>My OSX Mavericks Setup for Django development</h1>
    <p>I recently had to setup my machine for Python development from scratch. I had a couple of bookmarks of guides that run you through the process, but I soon found out they were pretty outdated. My <a href="http://blog.kristian.io/django/2013/10/23/setting-up-os-x-mavericks-for-python-development.html">co-founders blog post</a> was a good start, but I wanted to improve it a bit. So here goes.</p>
<h1>Install OSX and enable FileVault</h1>
<p>OSX installation is pretty straight forward. I did not fiddle with any advanced settings, except for region and keyboard configuration. Only suggestion I would have here is to use the US keyboard layout because special characters that are often used in programming are most easy to access (<code>;'\/.,[]{}()?=-+</code>). If you do occasionally need non-english characters, OSX has a really handy interface which is enabled when you hold down a key. Alternately, you can use multiple keyboards and switch with CTRL + SPACE.</p>
<p>FireVault is in my opinion essential and is easily enabled in the Security section of System Preferences. Just make sure to use a strong login password that you can remember. If you happen to forget it, and you trust Apple, you can have a security backup of your encryption key stored on iCloud.</p>
<h1>OSX configuration</h1>
<h4>Enable apps from everywhere</h4>
<p>By default, in OSX, some applications that you download from the Web cannot be run, since they do not originate from &quot;identified developers&quot;. If you want to disable this functionality go to Security and Privacy and set &quot;Allow apps downloaded from&quot; to &quot;Anywhere&quot;</p>
<h4>Lock screen</h4>
<p>If you work in an open office environment and are concerned about other people snooping your computer while you leave, you can get a handy lock screen shortcut on your task bar by opening Keychain Access, then going to Preferences and selecting &quot;Show Keychain status in menu bar&quot;. There is also a shortcut for it: CTRL + SHIFT + EJECT.</p>
<h1>Must have software</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> for password management</li>
<li><a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/">SizeUp</a> for quick window management</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> (use <code>ln -s &quot;/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl&quot; /usr/local/bin/subl</code> to enable the command line tool)</li>
<li><a href="http://gitx.laullon.com/">GitX (L)</a> (command line tools are installable from the menu)</li>
<li><a href="http://getcloudapp.com/">Cloud App</a> for instantly shareable screenshots</li>
</ul>
<h1>Terminal</h1>
<p>While some people suggest to install <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, I prefer sticking to the default Terminal app. One small issue I had with it was the DELETE key not working as expected. It would type a tilde (~) instead of deleting forward. Luckily, the key is easily configurable in the app itself. Just go to Preferences, Keyboard and map the delete key to CTRL + Option + D. The action should show <code>\004</code>.</p>
<h2>Oh My ZSH</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Oh My ZHS</a> enables use of advanced shell scripts. I use scripts by Kristian Oellegaard. More info can be found <a href="https://github.com/KristianOellegaard/zsh-plugins">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Homebrew</h2>
<p><a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is kinf-of like apt-get for Mac. It's a must. Install it with:</p>
<p>ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&quot;</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>brew install postgresql</p>
<p>To run postgres on startup:</p>
<p>ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents</p>
<h2>Install setuptools and PIP</h2>
<p>Installing setuptools and PIP has changed a bit since the last time I did it. Best way to do it is to download the provided script and run it <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html">as described here</a>.</p>
<h2>That's it!</h2>
<p>Now you are pretty much ready to go. Not as hard as I remembered it to be. Happy programming!</p>
